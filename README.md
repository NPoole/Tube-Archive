# Tube-Archive

This archive was originally seeded with 2GB of documents collected by Lindsay Wilson (http://imajeenyus.com/) which has been thinned out to materials more-or-less directly related to electron tubes. I plan to further organize these documents into a Wiki and add to them going forward. This project began as a result of Hackaday Supercon 2022 and the formation of a DIY Tubes Discord server.
